# Pre-Processor Directives

Pre-processor directives are special instructions in your source code that begin with a `#` symbol and are handled by the preprocessor before the actual compilation begins. They include:

- **Including Files:**  
  - Use `#include` to insert the contents of header files into your source file.
  
- **Defining Macros:**  
  - Use `#define` to create macros, which act as placeholders or constants that can simplify code and improve readability.
  
- **Conditional Compilation:**  
  - Use directives like `#if`, `#ifdef`, and `#ifndef` to selectively compile portions of your code based on specific conditions.  
  - This allows you to include or exclude code for different platforms or configurations.
