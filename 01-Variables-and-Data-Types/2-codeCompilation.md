# How C++ Code is Compiled and Run

C++ code goes through several distinct stages before it can be executed on your computer. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the process:

1. **Preprocessing**
   - **Preprocessor Directives:** Before actual compilation, the preprocessor handles directives like `#include`, `#define`, and conditional compilation (`#if`, `#ifdef`, etc.). It essentially expands these commands, inserting header files and macros into the source code.

2. **Compilation**
   - **Translation to Assembly:** The compiler takes the preprocessed code and translates it into assembly language. During this stage, it checks for syntax errors, optimizes the code, and converts high-level C++ constructs into low-level instructions.

3. **Assembly**
   - **Object Code Generation:** An assembler converts the assembly code into object code, which is a binary format that contains machine code but is not yet a complete program. Each source file typically becomes its own object file (e.g., `.o` or `.obj`).

4. **Linking**
   - **Combining Object Files and Libraries:** The linker takes all the object files, along with any required libraries (standard libraries or third-party libraries), and combines them into a single executable. This step resolves references between files (e.g., function calls across different source files).

5. **Execution**
   - **Running the Program:** Once the executable is created, you can run it directly. The operating system loads the executable into memory, and the CPU begins executing the machine code instructions.
