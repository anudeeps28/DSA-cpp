# Naming Conventions

1. **Start Character**  
   - The name should start with either an underscore (`_`) or a letter (e.g., `a`–`z`, `A`–`Z`).

2. **Allowed Characters**  
   - The name can include:
     - Uppercase letters (`A`–`Z`)
     - Lowercase letters (`a`–`z`)
     - Digits (`0`–`9`)
     - Underscores (`_`)

3. **Restrictions**  
   - **No Keywords:** You cannot use keywords (reserved words) as identifiers because they have special meaning to the compiler.
